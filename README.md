# JARVIS-Inspired Voice-Powered AI Assistant Embedded Web Application

Welcome to my project!this repository showcases how to build a voice-controlled AI assistant—reminiscent of JARVIS from Iron Man—using Lovable AI, ElevenLabs, and n8n. The best part? You don't have to write a single line of code!

Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a fully functional voice assistant that can:

Schedule meetings: Automatically trigger n8n workflows to set up meetings.

Manage calendar events: Delete any unwanted events.

Handle emails: Write and reply to emails using voice commands.

By integrating these powerful tools, you can manage your calendar and emails simply by talking to your assistant.

Features
Voice-Activated Commands: Leverages ElevenLabs for seamless voice interaction.

Intuitive Interface: Built with Lovable AI for a user-friendly experience.

Automation: Uses n8n to create workflows that handle your scheduling, event management, and email communication.

No-Code Setup: Perfect for those who want to harness AI and automation without the need for coding skills.

Technologies Used
Lovable AI: Creates an engaging, customizable interface for the assistant.

ElevenLabs: Powers voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities.

n8n: Automates workflows for scheduling meetings, managing calendar events, and handling emails.

How It Works
Voice Interaction: Speak commands to your assistant.

Workflow Trigger: Your voice command triggers an n8n workflow.

Task Execution: n8n carries out tasks such as scheduling meetings, deleting calendar events, or sending emails.

Feedback: Receive voice feedback from your assistant via ElevenLabs.
